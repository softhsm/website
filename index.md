SoftHSM is an implementation of a cryptographic store accessible through a PKCS #11 interface. You can use it to explore PKCS #11 without having a Hardware Security Module. It was originally developed as a part of the OpenDNSSEC project. SoftHSM uses Botan or OpenSSL for its cryptographic operations.
